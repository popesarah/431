**Data and code downloads** are at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431data. Click on the green **Clone or download** button, and then select **Download ZIP** to obtain a Zip file of the latest materials.

To **get started with R, R Studio and R Markdown** (especially after Class 2 and before Assignment 1) take a look at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/431-getting-started-with-R.pdf

Course **homework assignments** and **answer sketches** are found at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework

The **presentation slides** for each class will be posted at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides. Beginning with Class 3, I've built a README file (linked at the [presentation slides page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431slides)) with all of the announcements and administrative details related to that session's class. Please **be certain** you look at this material, especially if you're missing class.

**Teaching Assistant Office Hours** are held in WG-56 (Computing Lab) or WG-67 (Student Lounge) on the ground floor of the Wood building, so be sure to look in both places if you need help. The TAs are available 11:30 - 12:30, 2:30 - 4:30 and 5:45 - 6:45 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and also 4:30 - 5:30 on Fridays. This schedule is also found in the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/). Email **431-help at case dot edu** for help outside of office hours.

If you are trying to get help from **431-help at case dot edu**, that's great, but if you are trying to get help about an R problem send us (a) **your complete R Markdown file**, and (b) **a screen shot or copy-and-paste listing of the error message you're seeing**, please.
